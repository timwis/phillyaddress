<h1>Philly Address</h1>
<p>
Okay guys, good news and news that leaves room for improvement. The good news is that the City of Philadelphia has released a 
<a href="http://property.phila.gov">brand new Property Search App</a> that works well on mobile devices and will hopefully do for you what Philly Address 
once did. The <i>room for improvement news</i> is that because the new app doesn't include tax information or the ability to search by owner, and the old 
property search app was taken down to make room for it, Philly Address no longer works.
</p>

<p>We (I now work for the City) are working on it, and would love to hear about what data you're after and why it's important to you. Join our community at
