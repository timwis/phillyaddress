<h1>OPA API</h1>

This provides an API for <a href="http://opa.phila.gov" target="_blank">opa.phila.gov</a> by fetching their data on request, scraping it and providing it in a software-friendly format such as JSON, XML, PHP or Text.<br />
In addition, it scrapes the tax balances for the property from the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/RealEstateTax/" target="_blank">Department of Revenue</a> web site.<br />
Note that this is a <b>live</b> API and pulls directly from the OPA/Revenue web sites. Therefore it may not be the same data as phillyaddress.com, as phillyaddress.com is static.<br /><br />
